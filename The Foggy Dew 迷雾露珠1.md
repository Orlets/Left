    As down the glen one Easter morn
    复活节的早晨我走下峡谷
    To a city fair rode I
    骑着马去城里赶集
    Their armed lines of marching men
    全副武装的男人排成行
    In squadrons passed me by
    列队走过我身边
    No pipe did hum, no battle drum
    风笛不鸣 战鼓沉寂
    Did sound its loud tattoo
    什么声音在响亮的敲击
    But the Angelus' bells o'er the Liffey's wells
    只有祈祷的钟声回荡在利菲河谷
    Rang out in the foggy dew
    响彻在这浓雾中

    Right proudly high in Dublin town
    正义之气高扬在都柏林城
    Hung they out a flag of war
    他们扬起了战旗
    'Twas better to die 'neath an Irish sky
    就是死在爱尔兰的天空下
    Than at Suvla or Sud el Bar
    也好过死在苏弗拉湾和Sud el Bar
    And from the plains of Royal Meath
    于是在米斯郡王室的草原上
    Strong men came hurrying through
    壮士们匆匆而过
    While Brittania's Huns with their long-range guns
    这时英国佬扛着他们的长枪
    Sailed in through the foggy dew
    正启程穿越这浓雾

    'Twas Brittania bade our wild geese go
    就算英国人带走了我们的野鹅
    That small nations might be free
    这小小国度仍会解放
    But their lonely graves are by Suvla's waves
    但苏弗拉波涛边孤独的陵寝
    On the shore of the gray North Sea
    静静躺在在灰色北海岸边
    But had they died by Pearse's side
    那些与皮尔斯一同牺牲
    Or fought with Cathal Brugha
    或与卡索尔·布鲁一起奋战的人们
    Their names we would keep where the Fenians sleep
    他们的名字留在这芬尼亚人沉睡地
    'Neath the shroud of the foggy dew
    被笼罩在这雾深露重之处

    The bravest fell, and the requiem bell
    勇士倒下 挽钟长鸣
    Rang mournfully and clear
    钟声悲哀而清脆
    For those who died that Easter-tide
    为了这些死在复活节季的人们
    In the springing of the year
    在这年的春天
    While the world did gaze with deep amaze
    全世界震惊地注目着
    At those fearless men but few
    这些无畏的而少有的男人
    Who bore the fight that freedom's light
    他们为自由之光而战
    Might shine through the foggy dew
    光芒可能穿越这浓雾

    And back through the glen I rode again
    每当我骑马重归峡谷
    And my heart with grief was sore
    悲伤的心依旧疼痛
    For I parted then with valiant men
    因为那时和勇士们的分离
    Whom I never shall see more
    让我再也见不到他们
    But to and fro in my dreams I go
    但我反复走入梦境
    And I kneel and pray for you
    跪下并为你们祈祷
    For slavery fled, oh, glorious dead
    因为不愿被奴役而光荣战死
    When you fell in the foggy dew
    在这个春天你们倒在这浓雾中
